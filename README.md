# AML_BBN_RA
The project deals with developing an integrated safety and security risk assessment concept using AutomationML, Bayesian belief network and Python. This repository represents the use of Automation Markup Language (AutomationML or AML) https://www.automationml.org/ model to conduct automated risk assessment. Here the demonstration shows AML use for integrated safety and Security Risk assessment. AML is an XML-based object-oriented data modeling language for storing and exchanging system engineering data. It is available as an open standard. The development of AML is motivated by the digitization of Industrial control systems (ICSs). System documentation of the complete system in a detailed structure, behavior, and property representation is possible. AML modeling has been used in many industries for storing and exchanging data. It has been in use for more than a decade in manufacturing applications such as digital twins, re-configurable modular production system, and heterogeneous data exchange. The AML is developed in AutomationML editor available at https://automationml.org/download-archive/. The further process of risk assessment and propagation of the modelled AML is done using an integrated risk assessment method and python. Bayesian belief network is used to integrate safety and security risk assessment while using pgmpy library available in Python.
